        <h1>Grandma's Carrot cake</h1>
        <img src="../images/carrot-cake.jpg" alt="Image of carrot cake" class="proportioned">
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>From its warming spices to its fresh, often fruity flavor, carrot cake teeters between a fall and spring dessert. When it comes to Easter, however, no dessert rivals the carrot cake's classic appeal.</p>
        <p>"Different from traditional carrot cakes, this cake is extremely moist and flavorful and is topped with a buttermilk glaze while still warm."</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons baking soda</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>2 cups white sugar</li>
            <li>1 cup vegetable oil</li>
            <li>3 eggs</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 cup chopped walnuts</li>
            <li>1 (15 ounce) can crushed pineapple, drained</li>
            <li>2 cups carrots, grated</li>
            <li>1 cup flaked coconut</li>
            <li>½ cup butter</li>
            <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
            <li>½ cup buttermilk</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            </ul>
            

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13 inch pan. Sift together the flour, baking soda and cinnamon. Set aside.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, combine the sugar and oil until blended. Beat in the eggs one at a time, then stir in the vanilla. Stir in the flour mixture just until incorporated. Fold in the pineapple, carrots, coconut and walnuts. Pour batter into prepared pan.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 45 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. While still warm, poke holes in the cake with a fork.</li>
            <li>For the glaze: In a saucepan, combine butter, sugar, buttermilk and vanilla. Bring mixture to a boil over medium heat, then reduce heat and cook for 5 minutes. Pour glaze over warm cake, then allow to cool completely.</li>
        </ol>
